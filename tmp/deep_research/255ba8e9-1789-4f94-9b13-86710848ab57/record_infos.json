The paper explores the motivations behind the synergy of LLMs and RL, its successes, shortcomings, and alternative methodologies. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) form the core of RL, aiming to determine an optimal policy function \u03c0 that maps states to actions to maximize cumulative reward. LLMs use transformers and attention mechanisms to establish probability distributions across word sequences. Popular LLMs include BERT, GPT, PaLM, and LaMDA. The taxonomy includes RL4LLM (RL to improve LLMs), LLM4RL (LLM assists RL model training), and RL+LLM (LLM and RL agent in a common planning framework). RL4LLM is further divided into RL4LLM-Fine-tuning and RL4LLM-Prompt Engineering. LLM4RL is divided into LLM4RL-Reward, LLM4RL-Goal, and LLM4RL-Policy. RL+LLM is divided into RL+LLM-No Language Feedback and RL+LLM-With Language Feedback.",
